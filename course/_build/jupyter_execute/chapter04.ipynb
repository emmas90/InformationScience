    "## Information vs Database Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal discussions of information might start with the discussion of **information models**. __[Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_model)__ reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An information model in software engineering is a representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify __[data semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_data_model)__ for a chosen domain of discourse. Typically it specifies relations between kinds of things, but may also include relations with individual things. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models (...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Information retrieval then goes a step further and also discusses **information retrieval models**, as does chapter 3 of *Modern Information Retrieval* :\n",
    "\n",
    "> Modeling in IR is a complex process aimed at producing a ranking function, i.e., a function that assigns scores to documents with regard to a given query. This process consists of two main tasks: (a) the conception of a logical framework for representing documents and queries and (b) the definition of a ranking function that computes a rank for each document with regard to a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To build a model, we think first of representations of the documents and of the user information needs. In the case of a document, the representation might be a subset of all terms in the document, which can be generated by removing stopwords (such as articles and prepositions) from the text, for instance. In the case of a query the representation might be a superset of the query terms formed by the original query enriched with synonyms, for instance. Given these representations, we then concieve the framework in which they can be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while such models are obviously very interesting for information science, the discussion is also highly theoretical and requires no small amount of mathematics (set theory, algebra, probability theory, ...). Instead, from our practical perspective it makes more sense to open up the discussion of information, by dealing with **database models**. Indeed, in most real-world applications of information science, you will most likely have to deal with specific databases that stores information and not with the abstract information models that map the data to these databases. \n"

    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)__ defines a database as a \"an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system\". Such a broad definition allows for many different kinds of databases, ranging from a single text file (e.g. the line `apples,oranges,grapes` is a database!) to complex database management systems (DBMS) like __[MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)__ that operate on large data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database models\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification of databases is a topic for a course on its own. For now, it will suffice to say that the development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational, relational/SQL, and post-relational.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigational\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigational_database)__ says\n",
    "\n",
    ">A navigational database is a type of database in which records or objects are found primarily by following **references from other objects**. The term was popularized by the title of Charles Bachman's 1973 Turing Award paper, The Programmer as Navigator. This paper emphasized the fact that the new disk-based database systems allowed the programmer to choose arbitrary navigational routes following relationships from record to record, contrasting this with the constraints of earlier magnetic-tape and punched card systems where data access was strictly sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "(...)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Although Bachman described the concept of navigation in abstract terms, the idea of navigational access came to be associated strongly with the procedural design of the CODASYL Data Manipulation Language. Writing in 1982, for example, Tsichritzis and Lochovsky state that \"The notion of currency is central to the concept of navigation.\" By the **notion of currency**, they refer to the idea that a program maintains (explicitly or implicitly) a current position in any sequence of records that it is processing, and that operations such as `GET NEXT` and `GET PRIOR` retrieve records relative to this current position, while also changing the current position to the record that is retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relational/SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Wikipedia:Relational_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model)__ and __[Wikipedia:Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)__ say:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The relational model (...) is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, where all **data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations**. (...) he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records (...), Codd's idea was to organise the data as a number of \"tables\", each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or relations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called views could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Most relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-relational\n",
    "\n",
    "__[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)__ says:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non-SQL\" or \"non-relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in **means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases**. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but the name \"NoSQL\" was only coined in the early 21st century (...) NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages or sit alongside SQL databases in polyglot-persistent architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    ">(...) The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. keyâ€“value pair, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories of post-relational databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **key-value stores**, such as the MUMPS database by YottaDB that we use for Brocade, the University of Antwerp's Library Management System\n",
    "* **document stores**, such as XML or JSON\n",
    "* **triple stores**, such as RDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to realize here is that post-relational databases can express things that relational databases can't. For instance, how would you translate this JSON (postrelational) to a spreadsheet (relational)?\n",

    "\n",
    ">Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Web and initiator of the Linked Data project, suggested a 5 star deployment scheme for Linked Data. The 5 Star Linked Data system is cumulative. Each additional star presumes the data meets the criteria of the previous step(s).\n",

    "### RDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we do not have time to discuss RDF and Linked Data in detail. However, it is important to realize that RDF is a data model, not a data serialization model, such as XML or JSON - in fact, both can be used to express RDF data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick summary from __[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)__:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The RDF data model is similar to classical conceptual modeling approaches (such as entityâ€“relationship or class diagrams). It is based on the idea of making statements about resources (in particular web resources) in expressions of the form **subjectâ€“predicateâ€“object, known as triples**. The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects of the resource, and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, one way to represent the notion \"The sky has the color blue\" in RDF is as the triple: a subject denoting \"the sky\", a predicate denoting \"has the color\", and an object denoting \"blue\". Therefore, RDF uses subject instead of object (or entity) in contrast to the typical approach of an entityâ€“attributeâ€“value model in object-oriented design: entity (sky), attribute (color), and value (blue).\n",
    "\n",
    ">RDF is an abstract model with several serialization formats (i.e. file formats), so the particular encoding for resources or triples varies from format to format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of the triplestore and the underlying Linked Data principle is the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a unique and unambiguous ID for all things linked. Optimally linked data uses URIs for all three elements of the triple, subject, predicate and verb. To illustrate how this works, let's look at the (abbreviated) RDF/XML for the Wikidata entry __[Paris](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q90)__, known as entity `Q90`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "    <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q90\">\n",
    "        <wdt:P1376 rdf:resource=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q142\"/>\n",
    "    </rdf:Description>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a triple expressing the fact that \"Paris\" (subject) \"is the capital of\" (predicate) \"France\" (object). To express this three URIs are used: `Q90` (Paris), `P1376` (property \"is capital of\") and `Q142` (France). The makes the statement unique, uniform, unambiguous (telling a computer that Paris the city, not Paris Hilton (Q47899) is the capital of France), and linked: all elements of the triple are linked up to other data, e.g. `Q142` which was the object in this statement, will be the subject of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the difference with non-RDF XML where resources are not identified with URIs and data is not linked and the model not open:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "    <Description>Paris\n",
    "        <isCapitalof>France</isCapitalof>\n",
    "    </Description>\n",

Based on the semantics of Z39.50, its design objective is that queries be human readable and writable, and that the language be intuitive while maintaining the expressiveness of more complex query languages.

    "### What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "For your assignment you will be using the JSON data made available through the __[Europeana Entities API](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/entity)__, which allows you to search on or retrieve information from named entities. These named entities (such as persons, topics and places) are part of the Europeana Entity Collection, a collection of entities in the context of Europeana harvested from and linked to controlled vocabularies, such as â€‹Geonames, DBpedia and Wikidata. It is advisable to read the API's __[documentation](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/entity)__ first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick word in general about an __[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)__, or Application Programming Interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-technical users mostly interact with data through a GUI or Graphical User Interface, either locally (e.g. you use DBbrowser to look at a SQLite database) or on the web (e.g. you use Wikidata's web page). However, when we try to interact with this data from a machine-standpoint, i.e. in programming, this GUI is not suitable. We need an interface that is geared towards computers. So we use a local (e.g. Python's `sqlite3` module) or remote (e.g. __[Wikidata's Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org/)__) API to get this data in a way that can be easily handled by computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, an API is an intermediary structure, which has a lot of benefits. Wouldn't it be nicer to have direct access to a certain database? In a way, yes, but this would also cause problems. There are many, many different database architectures, but __[API architectures](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/comparing-api-architectural-styles-soap-vs-rest-vs-graphql-vs-rpc-84a3720adefa)__ are generally quite predictable. They are often based on well-known technologies like JSON or XML, so you don't have to learn a new query language. Moreover, suppose Wikidata changes their database? All of your code that uses the database would need to be rewritten. By using the API intermediary structure Wikidata can change the underlying database, but make sure their API still functions in the same way as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of free web APIs out there. The __[NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)__, for instance, is quite incredible. Or this __[Evil Insult Generator](https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=json)__, if you want to have some fun!\n",

    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is simple. Write a Python script that prompts for user input of a named entity, query the API for that entity, parse the results and print them on standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the key `wskey=apidemo` for your API request.\n",
    "- A good Python library to access URLs is `urllib`, an alternative (which is not in the standard library) is `requests`.\n",
    "- Think about what we have seen already about standardizing/normalizing search strings, but take this to the next level.\n",
    "- Try to anticipate what can go wrong so the program doesn't crash in unexpected situations.\n",
    "- Test your application with the following search strings: `Erasmus`, `Justus Lipsius` and `Django Spirelli`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is an easy task for you, you might think about parsing the results and adding them to your own database structure, e.g. XML or SQLite. \n"
