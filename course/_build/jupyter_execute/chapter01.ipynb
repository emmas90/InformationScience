    "My name is Tom Deneire, I hold a PhD in Classics from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (2009). \n",
    "\n",
    "From 2009-2013 I worked as a **postdoctoral researcher** (Neo-Latin Studies) and a visiting professor (Latin rhetoric and stylistics), focussing mainly on the interplay of Neo-Latin and the vernacular, literary theory and dabbling in (then emerging) Digital Humanities (see e.g. __[Deneire 2018](https://hdl.handle.net/10067/1535070151162165141)__).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013 I moved to the University Library of Antwerp as **Curator of the Special Collections**, where I became increasingly interested in library metadata and data science. I started studying  XML, SQL and Python, and using these digital tools to research and aggregate library metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018 this lead to a switch from the Special Collections to the University Library's software department __[Anet](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/projecten/anet/)__, where I have been  working since then as a **software engineer** for __[Brocade Library Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocade_Library_Services)__. My main languages are Python and especially __[MUMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS)__, the language for our database engine (GT.M, provided by __[YottaDB](https://yottadb.com/)__). My current project is a complete rewrite and integration of the library's double module for authority files. Occasionally, I also use SQL, Golang, PHP, Javascript and HTML/CSS. I use Linux as OS (esp. the __[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)__ distro).\n",

    "The above should make clear that I am not an expert in Information Science, nor a Computer Science major, nor have I been a professional developer for a long time. Indeed, at first I was not sure if I should really be teaching this course! So be warned that I will certainly not have all the answers in this course. On the other hand, my own profile is very kindred to that of my **intended audience**: humanities majors looking to acquire digital skills. I hope this common perspective will enable me to teach what such students need most from a vast field such as Information Science."

If this is really what you are after, I think there is enough scholarly literature out there to get by. Instead what is offered here is a very hands-on introduction into library science and the technologies used in the field. Indeed, I am not exaggerating if I claim that in my professional activities developing library software, I will use each and every one of the topics dealt with in this course on an almost **daily basis**.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To view the content **with code execution**, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use an editor with a Jupyter Notebook extension, such as __[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__\n",
    "2. install __[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)__ (Lab or Notebook) locally and open the notebooks in your browser\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to install Jupyter on your machine, you can open the notebooks with __[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/)__, but executing the code isn't always guaranteed to work (because of missing third-party libraries and stack overflows in heavy data operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the content **without code execution**, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. read the notebooks in this __[GitHub repository](https://github.com/TomDeneire/InformationScience/tree/main/course)__\n",
    "2. read the notebooks as a Jupyter Book hosted on __[GitHub Pages](https://tomdeneire.github.io/InformationScience)__\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain these course materials and to participate with the course, please do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fork this repo to your own GitHub account\n",
    "2. clone it to your local machine\n",
    "3. make and push changes \n",
    "\n",
    "The third step especially applies to the coding assignments (see below). By commiting and pushing your changes I will be able to see them by going through the different forks to my repo. And of course if you find errors in the other course materials or want to propose changes, you can also make pull requests.\n",
